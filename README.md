# BabySym App

This is an application that allows users to create selections of NFTs and share them with friends for feedback on the collection. The goal is to facilitate interaction and evaluation of NFT sets through a simple and intuitive process.

## Features

### 1. Contract Address Input

The application provides a screen where users can input the contract address of an NFT collection. This enables the identification and visualization of items within that collection.

### 2. Collection Visualization

After entering the contract address, the user is directed to a screen where they can view all items belonging to the NFT collection. This functionality provides a detailed preview of the available elements.

### 3. Selection and Sharing

Users have the ability to select specific NFTs from the collection and create a personalized set. This set can be shared via a link generated by the application. Easily share your selections and invite friends to provide feedback.

### 4. Evaluation of Shared Sets

When other users access the shared link, they are presented with an interface that allows them to evaluate the NFTs in the set. Additionally, the average of the evaluations is displayed, providing a quick overview of the collective feedback received so far.
